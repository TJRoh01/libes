**What is the name of the algorithm and/or dependency that needs changing?**
_Single line algorithm and/or name, same as in title_
e.g. x25519 & x25519-dalek

**What (and why) needs to be changed?**
_Free text_
e.g. The dependency has implemented X incorrectly, and that makes it unsafe to use. Their implementation has omitted operation Y.

**What needs to be done to resolve this?**
_Free text_
e.g. Use dependency X instead, which correctly includes operation Y.
